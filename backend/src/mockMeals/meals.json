The dough will be fairly firm, like shortbread dough. You can use the dough immediately, or chill for later.\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 200C/gas 6/fan 180C. Line 18 holes of two 12-hole patty tins, by pressing small walnut-sized balls of pastry into each hole.\r\n\r\nSpoon 280g mincemeat into the pies.\r\n\r\nTake slightly smaller balls of pastry than before and pat them out between your hands to make round lids, big enough to cover the pies. \r\n\r\nTop the pies with their lids, pressing the edges gently together to seal \u2013 you don\u2019t need to seal them with milk or egg as they will stick on their own. (The pies may now be frozen for up to 1 month).\r\n\r\nBeat 1 small egg and brush the tops of the pies. Bake for 20 mins until golden. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 mins, then remove to a wire rack.\r\n\r\nTo serve, lightly dust with icing sugar.",

The mixture should thicken and turn into a heavy, thick sauce.\r\n\r\nPour the mixture into a shallow container, cover and refrigerate for several hours, or until the sauce has solidified.\r\n\r\nTake a heaping tablespoon of the cold, thick sauce and quickly roll it into a small ball. Roll lightly through the flour, then the egg and finally the breadcrumbs. Make sure that the egg covers the whole surface of the bitterbal. When done, refrigerate the snacks while the oil in your fryer heats up to 190C (375F). Fry four bitterballen at a time, until golden.\r\n\r\nServe on a plate with a nice grainy or spicy mustard. \r\n",
